## Personal AI Employee Hackathon 0: Building Autonomous FTEs (Full-Time Equivalent) in 2026

## 🤖 AI Employee Vault

Your Autonomous Digital Employee — Powered by Markdown

A transparent, file-native AI assistant system that thinks, plans, and executes — with you in control.

## 🌟 Overview

AI Employee Vault is a structured, autonomous agent system built entirely inside Obsidian using plain Markdown files.

Instead of hidden databases, background pipelines, or black-box automation, everything happens through visible file movements inside folders. Every action the AI takes is traceable, auditable, and reversible.

If a traditional AI assistant feels invisible, this one feels like a transparent digital employee working inside your file system.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

AI Employee Vault stands on the shoulders of powerful open-source tools and ecosystems that make transparent autonomy possible.

This system is built with:

Python 3.10+ — The core engine powering automation, orchestration, and reasoning logic

Obsidian — The human-readable vault interface where every state lives as Markdown

Google APIs — Secure integration for Gmail and Calendar workflows

MCP Protocol — Modular agent-to-tool communication architecture

Playwright — Reliable browser automation for web-based execution

Each of these technologies plays a critical role in ensuring that the AI remains:

Transparent

Extensible

Auditable

Human-controlled

It’s the one that works beside you — in folders you control.”
